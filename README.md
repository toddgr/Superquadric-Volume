# Superquadric-Volume
1. Calculate the volume of a superquadric using parallel reduction.
2. Use a variety of number of subdivisions (NUMNODES). Trials include series of nodes 10, 50, 100, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 5000.
3. Use a variety of number of threads (NUMT). Trails implement thread counts of 1, 2, 4, and 8/

The C++ file provides the source code, results.csv provides the performance results, and the BASH file is included to run the benchmarks.
