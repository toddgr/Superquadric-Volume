# Superquadric-Volume
Calculate the volume of a superquadric using parallel reduction.

1. Compute the total volume by using the given Height function. (Note that this will give you Z=0. to Z=Height. As the superquadric has a negative half in addition to a positive half, double the 0.-Height volume as your final answer.
2. Use a variety of number of subdivisions (NUMNODES). Pick at least 8 different ones.
3. Use a variety of number of threads (NUMT). You must use at least 1, 2, and 4.
4. Record the data in units of something that gets larger as speed increases.
